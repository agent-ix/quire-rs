# FR-062: The requirement-to-production-code relation

## Description

`FR-051` mints `verifies`, linking an **evidence symbol** — a test, a benchmark, a fuzz target — to
a spec trace id. Nothing linked a **requirement to the production code that implements it**.

That gap is measurable. Across this repository's 52 FRs, **38 have at least one mutable target and 14
have none** (CR-071). The fourteen fail for one reason: every symbol verifying them lives in
`tests/`, which holds test code only, so a computed file set names no production file. `FR-053` is
the clean case — 17 bound test cases, all in `tests/obligations.rs`, and nothing connects it to
`src/obligation.rs`.

**Reach therefore correlates with test placement, not with requirement quality**, and inversely with
recency: the FRs whose tests are `#[cfg(test)]` modules inside the production file work by accident,
while the newer integration-tested work does not. Mutation scoping over that set measures where tests
live.

### Two relations, and no path from one to the other

This is the constraint the whole requirement exists to preserve.

| Relation | Means | May back an acceptance criterion |
|---|---|---|
| `verifies` | *"this test would fail if the behaviour broke"* | **yes** — it is evidence |
| `implements` | *"this code is what the requirement is about"* | **never** — it is scope |

`CR-061` stopped `verifies` binding production symbols precisely because a doc comment in
`src/foo.rs` that merely *cites* `FR-053-AC-1` would otherwise count as evidence backing it, letting
unverified code claim coverage. **Widening `verifies` was the wrong fix, and so is a shared type with
a discriminator** — that puts one typo between scope and evidence.

### The separation is structural, not conventional

Three independent things keep them apart, and none of them is a naming convention:

1. **A separate declared list.** `trace_tags.implements`, not a flag on `trace_tags.markers`.
2. **A separate relation type.** `ImplementsRelation`, not `VerifiesRelation` with a field.
3. **Complementary symbol kinds.** `verifies` binds only evidence symbols
   (`TestFunction`/`Benchmark`/`FuzzTarget`); `implements` binds only production symbols
   (`Function`/`Container`).

Point 3 is what makes a mis-declared pattern harmless: an `implements` marker on a test binds
nothing, and a `trace` marker on a production function binds nothing. Getting it wrong yields *no*
relation rather than the *wrong* one.

`ImplementsRelation` carries no `provenance`, because there is no legacy `implements` form to migrate
from and inventing the field would suggest one exists.

### It answers more than mutation scoping

Mutation scoping is the case that surfaced it, but the same edge answers *"which requirements does
this diff touch"* — the input to scoped CI, impact analysis and review routing.

## Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Criteria | Verification |
|----|----------|--------------|
| FR-062-AC-1 | A production symbol carrying a declared `implements` marker mints an `implements` relation, and that relation backs no trace id. | Test (TC-936) |
| FR-062-AC-2 | An `implements` marker on an evidence symbol, and a `verifies` marker on a production symbol, each bind nothing — the kinds are complements. | Test (TC-937) |
| FR-062-AC-3 | A requirement named by several markers yields one relation, ordered deterministically. | Test (TC-938) |

## Constraints

| ID | Constraint | Type | Validation |
|----|-----------|------|------------|
| FR-062-CON-1 | `implements` SHALL NOT contribute to `backed_trace_ids`, nor to any FR-050 rollup figure. It is scope, and counting it as evidence is the backdoor CR-061 closed. | Design | Test (TC-936) |
| FR-062-CON-2 | The engine SHALL NOT declare a marker pattern. The forms are module data, exactly as `verifies` forms are. | Design | Inspection |
| FR-062-CON-3 | `implements` SHALL NOT reuse `VerifiesRelation`. Two questions, two types, and no field a typo can flip between them. | Design | Inspection |

## Dependencies

- **Upstream**: [FR-051](./FR-051-source-symbol-extraction.md) (the marker grammar this extends), [FR-045](./FR-045-filament-core-extraction-engine.md) (symbol identity)
- **Downstream**: `agent-ix/quoin` FR-039 — mutation scoping, which needs a requirement's production files to be more than an accident of test placement
